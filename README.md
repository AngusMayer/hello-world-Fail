# hello-world
This is my first ever repository on GitHub: I am excited about entering the world of coding for the first time!
I need to learn some fricking code languages!!! It's 2:07 in the morning here in Ecuador and I can't wait to get back to my life here, the cinema tomorrow with ma new gal Kony, exciting times ahead!!!
Thoughts on how we have become so much more used to sharing ourselves, baring ourselves, sharing with the world since the dawn of the internet and especially facebook.com 


what is node.js and what is coffeescript?
what are the best languages to learn?
what languages will help me to work at google?
what about python, ruby on rails, java, html, css, c+, c++ - do they do different things, work with different kinds of files/data, acheive different results? what is fb written in? myspace? quora? google products? skype? spotify? soundcloud? in b flat? youtube?! 

lol - i know nothing - good!
